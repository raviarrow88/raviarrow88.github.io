In this Post, I am going to discuss about how to change the DRF+SQL to DRF+MongoDB like the changing the models,views etc.

To use Django with Mongodb,install **MonogoEngine** for the Django Rest Framework.

Let's Know **What is MongoEngine?** MongoEngine is a Document-Object Mapper (think ORM, but for document databases) for working with MongoDB from Python. It uses a simple declarative API, similar to the Django ORM

To install Mongoegine: https://github.com/umutbozkurt/django-rest-framework-mongoengine 


I am taking a simple Django app which uses the SQL database  and then convert them into Django with MongoDB
 
 Firstly :
    Model :A model can be as the definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you’re storing
    Each attribute in the model is treated as the database field
     
 DRF: models.py
    I have created a model a Book with attributes title,book_title,abstract and full_text
 
    from __future__ import unicode_literals
    from django.db import models
     
     
    class Book(models.Model):
    """
        Model  created  with fields

    """
        title = models.CharField(max_length=1000, db_index=True,)
        book_title = models.CharField(max_length=120, db_index=True)
        abstract = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
        full_text = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)

 DRF+mongoengine: models.py
    
    from __future__ import unicode_literals
    from  mongoengine import *
    
    class Book(Document):
        title = StringField()
        book_title = StringField()
        abstract = StringField()
        full_text = StringField()
    
    
 
 **No need to register the app name in the admin because we are using mongodb and no need of migration.**
 
 
 **Serializers:** : Django’s serialization framework provides a mechanism for translating Django models into other formats like xmi,json.
 
 DRF: serializer.py
 
     from rest_framework import serializers
     from .models import Book
     class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
   
        class Meta:
            model = Book
            fields = '__all__'
            
 DRF+mongoengine: serializer.py
 
    from rest_framework_mongoengine import serializers
    from .models import  Book

    class BookSerializer(serializers.DocumentSerializer):
        class Meta:
            model = Book
            fields = '__all__'
 
 In DRF, ModelSerializer is used,which automatically parses the model data into JSON,XMI formats.On the other side ,i.e in DRF+Mongoengine Documentserializer is used.
 
 
 **Views** : A view is a place where we keep the logic of our application. It will request information from the model and returns the response.
 
 DRF: views.py
 
    from .models import Book
    from rest_framework import generics
    from .serailizer import BookSerializer
    from .pagination import BookPagination
    
    
    class BookListView( generics.ListAPIView):
    """

    This view  returns the serailized data in JSON format with pagination applied with search and filter methods.

    """
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
    pagination_class = BookPagination
 
 
 DRF+mongoegine views.py
    
    from .model import Book
    from rest_framework_mongoengine import viewsets
    from .serializer import BookSerializer
 
    class BookViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):

    lookup_field = 'id'
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
    paginate_by = 10

    def get_queryset(self):
        return Book.objects.all()
        
 
 
 I am giving you the basic idea how to change to MongoDB.
 
 
 All d Best cheers...:)
